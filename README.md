## C4 PROJECTS SUMMER MENTORSHIP PROGRAM  (ML)
This repository has been created to document and store all files (mainly projects and assignments) pertaining to the Summer Mentorship Program organised by C4 Projects. This program really helped me hone my skills in the field of Machine Learning through hands-on projects under the guidance of a mentor.
